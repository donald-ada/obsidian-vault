# anthrosidian — Claude Code Plugin

A Claude Code plugin that connects your Obsidian knowledge base to any project session. Write daily logs, compile wiki articles, search your vault, and audit your knowledge base — all without leaving your terminal.

## Features

- **Daily logging**: Capture notes, bug fixes, and insights directly into today's daily note
- **Wiki compilation**: Transform raw source materials into structured wiki articles
- **Knowledge Q&A**: Search and answer questions from your Obsidian wiki
- **Health checks**: Detect broken links, orphan articles, and missing index entries
- **URL ingestion**: Paste a URL to fetch and save content via `obsidian:defuddle`
- **Works everywhere**: SessionStart hook injects vault context into every session, from any project directory

## Requirements

## Installation

### 1. Register the marketplace

Add to `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
"extraKnownMarketplaces": {
  "anthrosidian-plugin": {
    "source": {
      "source": "github",
      "repo": "donald-ada/anthrosidian"
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Enable the plugin

```json
"enabledPlugins": {
  "anthrosidian@anthrosidian-plugin": true
}
```

### 3. Run setup

In Claude Code (from any directory):

```
/anthrosidian:setup
```

Enter your vault path when prompted. Config is saved to `~/.claude/obsidian-vault.conf`.

> **Required**: The plugin will not activate without this config file. If the file is missing, each session will prompt you to run `/anthrosidian:setup`.

## Vault Structure

```
your-vault/
├── daily/          Daily notes (YYYY-MM-DD.md)
├── wiki/           Compiled knowledge articles
│   └── _index.md   Master index
├── raw/            Source materials
├── output/         Generated reports
├── assets/         Images and media
└── templates/
    └── daily-note.md
```

## Configuration

Config file: `~/.claude/obsidian-vault.conf`

```bash
VAULT_PATH="/absolute/path/to/your/vault"
```

This file is **required**. Without it, the plugin will not know where your vault is and will prompt you to run setup.

To create or update: `/anthrosidian:setup [vault-path]`
